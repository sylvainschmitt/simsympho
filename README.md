# simsympho

*I should probably change the name later.*

This is a quick exploration of reusing the model from [Schwilt and Kerr (2002)](https://github.com/dschwilk/ms-data-Oikos-2002) to model the eco-evolutionnary dynamics of *Symphonia globulifera* with topography and forest gaps dynamics based on PhD results.

## News

* started integration as `Rcpp` package

## ToDo

* start versionning and all packageing stuff
